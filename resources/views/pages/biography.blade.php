                    every twice a week in a big crowd of people, this was every Friday and Saturday in church, even though his parents were in commercial farming business, they were as well singers in church.<br /><br /> Since childhood, 2T had always
                    passionately loved to sing, which drove him to join different groups of singers, this started when at the age of 5 years he formed a group consisting of him and his other siblings as well as also being in a children’s church choir.
                    While pursuing his high school studies, 2T joined different choirs like Bons Amis choir at Gitwe college, La victoire choir at Bethel college, 2T later still in high school joined other singing and dancing groups like N2G(new guys
                    group), T Sol.<br /><br />During genocide in 1994 at the age of 9 years, 2T (Rwanda reggae artist) lost his five brothers and his father so he survived with only his mother and 2 sisters, this led 2T to drop school for 2 years as he
                    was not interested of school anymore, due to genocide trauma, his mother died later of cardiac disease, this left 2T with a hard task of life with her 2 sisters.<br/><br />
